## Overview

This project investigates the economic and social factors that influence the number of billionaires in various countries. Leveraging data from the World Bank, Forbes, and other sources, the analysis applies Poisson regression models to identify key determinants such as GDP per capita, population size, tax rates, and economic freedom. The insights gained from this study contribute to understanding how economic policies and conditions foster or hinder extreme wealth accumulation.
